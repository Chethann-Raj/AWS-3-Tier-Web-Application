# 3-Tier-Web-Application
Multi-tier Architecture for a web application,used for high availability and scalability.

This architecture provides a scalable, fault-tolerant solution with load balancing and automatic scaling at each tier. The separation into different tiers allows for better management, scalability, and maintenance of the application.

The Nginx server serves the static content to the React.js website and redirecting API calls is a common practice, and the combination of Node.js for the application logic and Aurora MySQL for the database further enhances the overall robustness of the system.
